# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System

## 📌 Introduction
The AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a machine learning–powered
security application designed to detect malicious network activity.
This project uses the **Random Forest algorithm** to classify network traffic as
**Benign** or **Malicious** and provides an interactive **web-based dashboard**
using Streamlit.
