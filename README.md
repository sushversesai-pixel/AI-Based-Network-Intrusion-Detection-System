# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System

##  Introduction
The AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a machine learning–powered
security application designed to detect malicious network activity.
This project uses the **Random Forest algorithm** to classify network traffic as
**Benign** or **Malicious** and provides an interactive **web-based dashboard**
using Streamlit.

---

##  Objectives
- Detect network intrusions using Machine Learning
- Classify traffic into normal and attack categories
- Provide real-time traffic simulation and prediction
- Visualize performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
